## Features âœ¨

- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the Sudoku game.
- **Puzzle Generation**: Ability to generate new Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels by leveraging a **backtracing** algorithm.
- **Solution Validation**: Functionality to check the correctness of user inputs and provide feedback (game screens).
- **Intuitive Controls**: Dual Input Support (Mouse and Keyboard (Arrow Keys)).

## Learning and Collaboration

This project serves as a platform for us to:

- **Enhance Pyhton Skills**: By implementing algorithms, managing data structures, and creating a user interface.
- **Develop Teamwork**: Through collaborative coding, version control practices, and regular team meetings.
- **Problem-Solving**: By tackling challenges associated with game development and algorithm implementation.
